# Logisim Design of a Processor
This is the logisim design of a processor whose assembler and the supported instruction set can be reached from [here](https://github.com/erenulas/Assembler).
[Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) is used to create this design. <br/>
**Push and pop operations are not supported in the logisim design even though they are supported in the assembler.**

## How to Use It?
* Clone the repo.
* Open the '.circ' file with logisim tool.
* Load the instruction memory, and if necessary the data memory.
* Change the clock to run the instructions.
